Well the Sodbury Slog lived up to expectation. Mud and a really nice course. Dave, Tony and I all completed the course despite little training. Its definitely an event I expect us to enter yearly along with the Horton Bull run. A well organised event will good amount of people competing.

As you can see. You get muddy!
