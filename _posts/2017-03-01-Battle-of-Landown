Not much activity to report here. Training as a group has been minimal so far this year but individually weâ€™ve all done some form of fitness. The Battle of Lansdown was meant to change that but a football injury to Dave (While playing in goal!) means the Chuggers have yet to run competitvily together in 2017! However we did manage a single 10k training run in prep for this.  Fortunately Fowler was able step in a late notice and put in a quality effort and finish 9th out of 1045.

Tony (155th) and I (35th) both started in the elite category this year and put in good performances despite little training.
